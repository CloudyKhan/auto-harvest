# auto-harvest

**auto-harvest** is a Python script that automates the bulk downloading of files based on URL patterns with customizable placeholders. Itâ€™s ideal for scenarios where you have URL patterns and wordlists to substitute into the URLs, allowing for systematic, automated file retrieval.

## Getting Started

To download this script, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CloudyKhan/auto-harvest.git
cd auto-harvest
```

## Features

- Supports one or two placeholders (`FUZZ1` and `FUZZ2`) in URLs for pattern-based downloads.
- Allows downloading based on a single URL pattern or multiple URL patterns listed in a file.
- Saves downloaded files in a specified output directory.
- Customizable timeout for HTTP requests.

## Requirements

- **Python 3**
- **Requests library**: Install with `pip` if not already installed.
  ```bash
  pip install requests
  ```

## Usage

```bash
python3 auto-harvest.py [-u URL_PATTERN] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-t TIMEOUT] [-f1 FUZZ1_WORDLIST] [-f2 FUZZ2_WORDLIST] [--url-file URL_FILE]
```

### Options

- **`-u`, `--url-pattern`**: The base URL with `FUZZ1` and/or `FUZZ2` placeholders to specify where values from wordlists should be substituted.
- **`-o`, `--output-dir`**: The directory to save downloaded files. Defaults to `./downloaded_files` if not specified.
- **`-t`, `--timeout`**: Timeout for each HTTP request in seconds. Default is `10`.
- **`-f1`, `--fuzz1-wordlist`**: Wordlist file for `FUZZ1` placeholder.
- **`-f2`, `--fuzz2-wordlist`**: Wordlist file for `FUZZ2` placeholder.
- **`--url-file`**: File containing a list of URL patterns, each on a new line, to be processed.

## Examples

### Example 1: Download Files Using a Single URL Pattern and One Wordlist
Use a single URL pattern with one placeholder (`FUZZ1`) to download files.

```bash
python3 auto-harvest.py -u "http://example.com/docs/2020-FUZZ1.pdf" -f1 wordlist.txt -o ./my_downloads
```

In this example:
- `FUZZ1` in the URL pattern will be replaced by each entry in `wordlist.txt`.
- Files will be saved in the `./my_downloads` directory.

### Example 2: Download Files Using Two Placeholders and Two Wordlists
Use a URL pattern with both `FUZZ1` and `FUZZ2` placeholders for more complex substitutions.

```bash
python3 auto-harvest.py -u "http://example.com/docs/2020-FUZZ1-FUZZ2-report.pdf" -f1 months.txt -f2 days.txt -o ./reports
```

In this example:
- `FUZZ1` will be replaced by entries in `months.txt`.
- `FUZZ2` will be replaced by entries in `days.txt`.
- Files will be saved in the `./reports` directory.

### Example 3: Download Files Using Multiple URL Patterns from a File
Download files using several URL patterns listed in `patterns.txt`, each pattern containing `FUZZ1`.

```bash
python3 auto-harvest.py --url-file patterns.txt -f1 wordlist.txt -o ./batch_downloads
```

In this example:
- Each URL pattern in `patterns.txt` will have `FUZZ1` replaced by entries in `wordlist.txt`.
- Files will be saved in the `./batch_downloads` directory.

## Notes

- If only one wordlist is needed, you can omit the `-f2` argument, and `FUZZ2` will be ignored.
- The script will generate traffic proportional to the size of the wordlists. Consider limiting the size of wordlists to avoid high network traffic.
